# activity-tracker

Originally I had the thought to track the amount of time I sit every day. Later it struck me that it would be better to make an application with a widened
utility to use for my other tasks. I had recently learned hooks in React.js, so I thought it would be beneficial to put my newfound skills to use and make
this app a reality. Some coding later, and I came up with this.

The Activity Tracker is simple. Just type in an activity into the textfield near the top of the app just below the header. Once done, click the "+" and
the new activity should be appear. Multiple activities can be made, so users do not need to limit themselves to one. The functionality for each activity
involves starting and stopping the stopwatch, resetting the stopwatch, and deleting the activity. The Activity Tracker can also function as a todo list if
need be, because of the add and delete feature. 

Note: Once the browser window is closed, the user's progress will not be saved.
